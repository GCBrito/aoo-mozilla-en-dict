If you have an old version of Firefox/Thunderbird (59 or below)
you may use this .xpi.

Click on the "Download" button to download the .xpi. ⚠

Disable automatic updates in it after installing so that the
dictionary isn't automatically updated to the WebExtension

You will have to manually update every month.
